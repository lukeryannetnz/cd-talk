						# hello.
						
						I'm Luke
						<aside class="notes">
							I've been fortunate to have a career working on a variety of interesting problems at interesting times.
							I find the following fascinating:
							1. the productivity of software teams and how best to deliver value
							2. the optimal way to structure and architect software systems and how this affects 1.

							I have:
							- worked on web and fat client systems for government
							- worked on the facebook for windows phone product team
							- worked with azure in the early days of cloud computing
							- worked on operations/monitoring for a bank
							- worked on lots of cloud saas products including joining Xero as it scaled outside of ANZ and migrated to AWS
							- worked on an early stage startup uneeq in the conversational AI space

					<h2>DORA and Accelerate metrics</h2>
					<ul>

						DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA). <b>State of devops report</b>
						Organisation acquired by google
						Have done research into <b>high performing software engineering organisations</b>
						Found that these four metrics correlate with high organisational performance
						Published in a book called accelerate where they call out <b>5 capabilities to focus on</b> improving.  
						<b>Continuous delivery is one</b>, Karl mentioned that you are looking to deploy more often

						I've got a couple of slides, with three takeaways:
						1. Continuous delivery enables evolutionary architecture 
						2. Continuous delivery reduces waste (and accelerates delivery of value)
						3. Continuous delivery does not compromise stability

					<h2>Continuous delivery enables evolutionary architecture </h2>
					<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>2014, xero, product team around 230 people</li>
						<li>monolithic architecture</li>
						<li><b>big release process every 3 weeks. big video call.</b> early morning as most customers ANZ. bagels.</li>
						<li>limited monitoring & observability (logs, OS vitals)</li>
						<li>batch size was HUGE. deployment frequency was low. lead time was even longer. we regularly had post to ship fixes under stress</li>
						<li>we pushed to shift the architecture to a loosely coupled one</li>
						<li>before a release I realised that a change in our delta would break a critical path</li>
						<li><b>sleepless night. last minute merge to revert</b></li>
						<li>our architecture wasn't loosely coupled so we couldn't deploy independently, which ironically prevented us from evolving our architecture</li>
					</ul>

						As the number of developers increases, we found:

						<ul>
						<li> Low performers deploy with decreasing frequency. </li>

						<li>Medium performers deploy at a constant frequency. </li>

						<li>High performers deploy at a significantly increasing frequency.</li>
					</ul>
						This allows our business to move faster as we add more people, not slow down.
						We had added people, but our process was creaking at the seams.

						<h2> Continuous delivery reduces waste</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>a side effect of that proces above, we had dozens of branches which were "dev complete"</li>
								<li>these branches represent inventory, work in progress, or waste</li>
								<li>we couldn't merge and ship them, because:</li>
								<li>they were huge and had become risky</li>
								<li>they weren't a top priority anymore. we missed the window of value</li>
								<li>they were waste. they cost us developer time and added no customer value.</li>
								<li>they continued to cost developer time as we were maintaining them</li>
								<li>small batch size prevents this kind of waste</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>a different kind of waste is over-processing. </li>
								<li>at uneeq we had a core system which took <b>4 hours of an engineer nursing an ansible script</b> to deploy</li>
								<li>it was prone to human error, not to mention other concerns</li>
								<li>the business case for reducing this waste is simple. cost.</li>
								<li>this constrained our deployment frequency which meant we missed other benefits</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>companies with high software delivery performance also have high organisational performance (profitability, market share, productivity)</li>
								<li>given the lean manufacturing focus on reducing waste, I'm not surprised</li>
							</ul>

						<h2 ">Continuous delivery does not compromise stability</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>counter intuitively when deployment frequency increases, stability does not decrease</li>
								<li>this is because of the feedback loops of the other metrics</li>
								<li>going fast doesn't mean being reckless. </li>
								<li>when we launched uneeq creator we shipped a lot of product quickly</li>
								<li>we noticed that incident count (change failure rate) also increased, we were rushing</li>
								<li>Failure leads to enquiry - good culture of blameless postmortems and reflecting on failures. Good metrics culture.</li>
